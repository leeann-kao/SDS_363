**We are working with the Pizza Data Set. The group members are Vinny Sriram, Lee-Ann Kao, and Jennifer Centa.**

```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(heplots)

pizza <- read.csv("Pizza.csv")
pizza2 <- pizza[ ,c("brand", "id", "mois", "prot", "fat", "ash", "sodium", "carb", "cal")]
pizza2 <- pizza2[complete.cases(pizza2), ]
dim(pizza2)
```

### Question 1

```{r}
source("http://www.reuningscherer.net/multivariate/R/CSQPlot.r.txt")
CSQPlot(pizza2[,c(-1, -2)], label = "Raw Pizza Data")
```

### Question 2

```{r}
corrplot.mixed(cor(pizza2[,c(-1, -2)]), lower.col = "black", upper = "ellipse", tl.col = "black", number.cex = .7, order = "hclust", tl.pos = "lt", tl.cex = .7)

chart.Correlation(pizza2[,c(-1, -2)], histogram = TRUE, pch = 19)
```

*From the correlation plots it appears that ____ are highly correlated. Because there are many strong relationships, we think that PCA will help to narrow down the number of components/variables.*
